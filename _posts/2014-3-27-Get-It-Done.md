ToDo applications seem like the easiest apps to write but I still haven't found one that works for me. The fundamental problem with most I have tried is that they focus on the actual todo list and not on helping its users accomplish their tasks. <!-- more --> On top of that they don't focus on improving the user's management of tasks. They think all that is needed in a list with one view. They don't take into account any of the new thinking in process engineering. Ideas like limiting work in progress, providing feedback for process improvements, or only showing the user what they need to see at that particular point in time. 

I have decided to write a tool that will help me manage my list and furthermore manage my life. It will be designed around the following ideas:

##Everywhere## 
It has to be anywhere the user wants to use it - however they want to use it. It has to be a service that follows the user wherever they are. If I am sitting on a bus or hiking up a trail I want to be able to see the todo list and add to it. Accomplishing this design goal is going to require mobile versions, web versions and possible tablet versions. 

##Quick##
The time and effort it takes to get a task into the app has to be a small as possible. Once you think of a task that needs to be done you must be able to get it logged soon or the thought will disappear. Once I start thinking about how much work it will be to add the task I have already lost. 

##Day View##
A view that shows you the daily tasks helping you visualize the day's work and your progress against it. This idea has its roots in (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)[Kanban] and will work as motivational aid by showing you only the day's tasks instead of all of the tasks. That enables users to take daily baby steps instead of tackling the whole never-ending todo list at once.
