The is the beginning of the blog.
<!-- more -->
It is time for me to start chronicling my projects and open source work that I do. The motivation behind this blog is twofold. First, I will use this blog to not only explain what my projects do and secondly, for me to fully flesh out my views for the projects. 

Over the coming months I will post about the projects that I have already completed or am in the process of completing. This will help frame my focus for the projects that I want to do (of which there are many).  

The technology for this post is all provided for free by [GitHub](http://github.com). It is hosted by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) - a powerful blogging platform that supports [Jeykll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) both of which this blog uses.
